                                This application was developed with Angluar 14 as the client facing,
                                Microsoft .NET Core 7 as the server side technologies and Bootstrap 5
                                to strap the design of the application together.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This application takes advantage of the Google maintained JavaScript
                                framework, Angular, to build highly efficent and lightning fast 
                                single-page application. This means that all processes within the
                                can be easily rendered to the user in no time at all.

                                Furthermore, this was coupled with ASP.NET Core, which is a cross-platform, 
                                high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled, 
                                Internet-connected apps maintained by Microsoft. ASP.NET Core, is also packaged
                                with an object-relational mapper to work with relational data using domain-specific
                                objects. It helps to perform fast CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations
                                and aids visually designing models to map data to databases. This means a reduction 
                                of development time and development costs which leads to an easily scalable and 
                                maintainable application.
