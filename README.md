## Description of Tech Stacks
This project is a dating web application that was developed with Angular 14 as the client facing,
Microsoft .NET Core 7 as the server-side technologies and Bootstrap 5 to strap the design of the application together.
This application takes advantage of the Google maintained JavaScript framework, Angular, to build highly efficient and lightning-fast
single-page application. This means that all processes within the can be easily rendered to the user in no time at all.
Furthermore, this was coupled with ASP.NET Core, which is a cross-platform, high-performance, open-source framework for building modern, cloud-enabled,
Internet-connected apps maintained by Microsoft. ASP.NET Core, is also packaged, with an object-relational mapper to work with relational data using domain-specific
objects. It helps to perform fast CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations and aids visually designing models to map data to databases. 
This means a reduction of development time and development costs which leads to an easily scalable and maintainable application.

## Deployment Strategy
The Angular application was built, compressed and stored as a static site along with the Dotnet server files. The files were then deployed directly to Microsoft Azure and connected to a Azure SQL Server.
