 ## Description
This application was designed with a focus on user experience and functionality. The client-side of the application was built using Angular 14, 
while the server-side was developed using Microsoft .NET Core 7. The design of the application was brought together using Bootstrap 5, creating 
a cohesive and modern look. Additionally, the development process of this project emphasizes test-driven development and includes unit tests for 
each component. These tests are automated, ensuring that the application is free of bugs throughout the development process. The testing libraries 
used in this project include <b>NUnit</b> on .NET Core and <b>Jasmine</b> on Angular, providing comprehensive and reliable testing.

Currently, there is an SQLite Database attached as well.  

The password for all users is Pa$$w0rd  
admin username: admin  
regular username: chris
 
 ## What can this application do?
This application allows users to register for a new account by providing their username, password, and email through the use of reactive forms. 
These forms will inform the user of the required details needed for registration. Once registered, users can login to the application securely by 
utilizing a JSON Web Token (JWT), which is used to securely transfer information between the dotnet server and the client web application. Additionally, 
the application also includes admin features, which allow designated admins to delete users.
